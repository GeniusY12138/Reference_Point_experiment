  <h4>Report Your Certainty Equivalent for Every Lottery</h4>

  <p>
    In this stage, you will enter the amount at which you are indifferent between
    a sure payment and the lottery. We call this your <strong>Certainty Equivalent (CE)</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After you submit your CE, we will draw a random number.<br>
    • If the drawn amount is higher than your CE, you will receive the drawn amount.<br>
    • If the drawn amount is lower than your CE, you will receive the outcome of the lottery.<br>
    Your final payoff will be whichever of these two applies.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please enter your true CE.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reporting your true CE maximizes your expected payoff.</strong>

    <h4>Why Truth-Telling Is Best</h4>
    <p>
      The drawn amount is chosen independently of your CE. If you report a CE
      above your true indifference point, you risk receiving a sure payment
      that is worth less to you than the lottery’s expected value. If you
      report it below your true indifference point, you may end up with the
      lottery when you would have preferred the sure amount. Only by reporting
      your true CE can you never regret the offer you receive.
