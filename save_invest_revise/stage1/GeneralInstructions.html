  <p>
      In this experiment, you will be asked to make choices in several different scenarios. The experiments have two parts. At the end of the experiment, one of the scenarios will be selected at random, and you will receive payment based on the choices you made in that scenario. It is therefore important that you think carefully about your choices in each scenario.

      You will receive a $5 payment for your participation in cash today. All other payments will be made by electronic transfer (either Venmo or PayPal). You will be asked to provide your account details at the end of the experiment. The questions you will answer will involve choosing between payments, some of which will take place today and some in one month's time. Payments will take place in the evening of the specified day (so, for example, if you are asked a question which involves payment today, that payment will be sent to you this evening). In addition to the $5 in cash, you will also receive a $5 participation fee via electronic transfer today and a further $5 transferred to you in one month's time. Note this means that, regardless of the decisions you make in the experiment, you will receive 2 electronic transfers, one today and one in 1 month's time.
