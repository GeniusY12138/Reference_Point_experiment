<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this experiment, you will be asked to make decisions across two parts. At the end of the experiment, <b>one situation</b> from either part will be randomly selected, and your final payment will depend on your choices in that situation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You will receive a $5 participation fee in cash today. All other payments will be made via electronic transfer (e.g., Venmo or PayPal).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Stage One</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This stage presents 40 independent questions. In each, you begin with an endowment of $10. First you choose how much of that $10 to take as cash today. Whatever remains, you must split between two investments: Asset A and Asset B. Before each decision, you will see the probability that each asset will be the one to pay out and the rate of return if it is chosen. Exactly one asset will pay off in that scenarioâ€”if Asset A has a return of 1.4 and is selected, each dollar you invested in A yields $1.40; if Asset B is selected, only your B-investment pays according to its rate.<br>
